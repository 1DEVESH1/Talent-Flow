# üöÄ TalentFlow

**TalentFlow** is a mini hiring platform designed to help an HR team manage jobs, candidates, and job-specific assessments.  
This project is a sophisticated front-end application that simulates a full back-end API using **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** and ensures data persistence entirely through **IndexedDB** for a reliable **local-first experience**.

## ‚ú® Features

### üìã Job Management (Jobs Board)
- **Pagination & Filtering:** Displays jobs in a paginated table and allows filtering by job title search, as well as status (active or archived).  
- **CRUD Operations:** Complete functionality to Create, Edit, and Archive job listings via a modal form.  
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Users can reorder jobs using drag-and-drop, featuring optimistic UI updates that automatically rollback if the simulated API request fails (per the assignment requirements).  
- **Deep Linking:** Dedicated route (`/jobs/:jobId`) to view individual job details.  

### üßë‚Äçüíª Candidate Management (Kanban Board)
- **Virtualized List:** Handles a large dataset (1000+ seeded candidates) efficiently.  
- **Kanban Flow:** Candidates are organized by stage (applied, screen, tech, offer, hired, rejected) and can be moved between stages using drag-and-drop.  
- **Search & Filter:** Client-side search for quick filtering by candidate name or email.  
- **Candidate Profiles:** Dedicated route (`/candidates/:id`) showing profile details and a timeline of stage changes.  

### üìù Assessment Builder
- **Assessment Builder UI:** Allows non-technical users to build job-specific assessment forms per the assignment requirements.  
- **Live Preview Pane:** Renders the assessment form in real-time as questions are added or edited.  
- **Configurable Questions:** Supports defining question type, label, required status, and constraints (e.g., Min/Max for numeric questions).  
- **Supported Types:** Short Text, Long Text, Multi-Choice, Numeric with Range, and File Upload (stub).
